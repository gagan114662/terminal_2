# Developer Agent Command

Activate the BMAD Developer agent for code implementation and development.

## Usage
```
/developer [specific implementation requirements]
```

## What the Developer Agent Does
- Implements features based on architecture specifications
- Writes clean, maintainable, well-documented code
- Creates unit tests and integration tests
- Follows coding best practices and design patterns
- Handles error cases and edge conditions
- Optimizes code for performance and maintainability

## Workflow Position
The Developer agent typically follows the Architect agent and uses technical specifications to implement features.

## Example
```
/developer
```
or
```
/developer Implement the user authentication module first
```

The Developer agent will implement production-ready code based on architecture specifications, ready for the QA agent to review.
