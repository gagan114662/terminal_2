# Project Manager Agent Command

Activate the BMAD Project Manager agent for strategic planning and PRD creation.

## Usage
```
/pm [additional requirements or context]
```

## What the PM Agent Does
- Creates Product Requirements Documents (PRDs)
- Defines project scope and deliverables
- Establishes project timelines and milestones
- Identifies dependencies and critical path
- Sets success metrics and KPIs

## Workflow Position
The PM agent typically follows the Analyst agent and uses its findings to create strategic project plans.

## Example
```
/pm
```
or
```
/pm Focus on MVP features for initial release
```

The PM agent will transform analyst findings into actionable project plans and comprehensive PRDs ready for the Architect agent.
