# Architect Agent Command

Activate the BMAD Architect agent for system design and technical architecture.

## Usage
```
/architect [specific architectural requirements]
```

## What the Architect Agent Does
- Creates comprehensive system architecture
- Designs database schemas and data models
- Defines APIs and service interfaces
- Selects technology stack and frameworks
- Creates technical implementation guidelines
- Identifies technical risks and mitigation strategies

## Workflow Position
The Architect agent typically follows the PM agent and uses PRD requirements to design technical solutions.

## Example
```
/architect
```
or
```
/architect Use microservices architecture with PostgreSQL database
```

The Architect agent will transform PRD requirements into detailed technical specifications ready for the Developer agent to implement.
